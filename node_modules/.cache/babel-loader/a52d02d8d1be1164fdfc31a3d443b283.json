In practice, this may blend almost seamlessly with engine panels or wheel covers/mudguards (which in some cases will be painted or plated metal). These systems act to protect the rider from some or all of the weather, may improve aerodynamics (reducing drag), and are an important styling element.\n\nModern fairings, mostly designed specifically for each motorcycle and fitted as original equipment by the manufacturer, have eliminated the aerodynamic and structural failings of early add-on fairings. Both sports and tourer versions improve (sometimes very considerably) the rider's comfort in cold and wet weather and even \"bikini\" versions protect the vulnerable crotch region from water ingress. */}\n\n{/* </p> */}\n            <Page404/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Store;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
